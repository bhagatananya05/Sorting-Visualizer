# Sorting-Visualizer
A web that provides a better understanding of a bunch of some common sorting algorithms with the help of visual representation of how they work alongwith the
functionality of ‚è≥(Processing Speed Control) and üìè(Array Size Control)

**Sorting algorithms covered:**
1. Selection Sort.
2. Bubble Sort.
3. Insertion Sort.
4. Merge Sort.

## How it works ?!
-------------------
1. Each element's value is represented by ```THE SIZE OF THE BAR``` and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right.
2. The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements without using any addtional memory for creating another array.
3. Distinct colour theme is used for each operation-
 **_Comparing, Swapping and Displaying the part of array in consideration at the very moment_**.
